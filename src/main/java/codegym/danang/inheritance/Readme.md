Encapsulation: If we have some common attributes, then we encapsulate these in a parent class and just give specific attributes to child classes.
Polymorphism: We can also use Polymorphism with Inheritance in Java. So that based on the type of Child class, same class behaves differently.
Code Reusability: Using Inheritance helps in reusing code.
When you inherit from an existing class, you can reuse methods and fields of parent class, and you can add new methods and fields also
Runtime polymorphism cannot be achieved without using inheritance.
Inheritance provides data hiding. The base class can hide some data from the derived class by making it private
Method overriding cannot be achieved without inheritance. By method overriding, we can give a specific implementation of some basic method contained by the base class.
